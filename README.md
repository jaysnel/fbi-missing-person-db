# fbi-missing-person-db

This is a project to make more aware of missing children. This specific project uses googles puppeteer to go out and scrape https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/kidnap
to gather information on missing children. This data is scraped and stored, then used to provide a public facing api for other developers.

This project is for non-commercial, and not for profit.
